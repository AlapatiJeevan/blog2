    <h1>HISTORY OF ANIME</h1>
    <p>The <b>history of anime</b> can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1917. Before the advent of film, Japan already had a rich tradition of entertainment with colourful painted figures moving across the projection screen in utsushi-e (写し絵), a particular Japanese type of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_lantern" target ="_blank">Magic Latern</a> show popular in the 19th century. Possibly inspired by European phantasmagoria shows, utsushi-e showmen used mechanical slides and developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could each control the motions of different projected figures.

        The second generation of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kōuchi and Seitarō Kitayama, commonly referred to as the "fathers" of anime. Propaganda films, such as Momotarō no Umiwashi (1943) and Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei (1945), the latter being the first anime feature film, were made during World War II. During the 1970s, anime developed further, with the inspiration of Disney animators, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing distinct genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre. Typical shows from this period include Astro Boy, Lupin III and Mazinger Z. During this period several filmmakers became famous, especially Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru Oshii.
        
        In the 1980s, anime became mainstream in Japan, experiencing a boom in production with the rise in popularity of anime like Gundam, Macross, Dragon Ball, and genres such as real robot, space opera and cyberpunk. Space Battleship Yamato and Super Dimension Fortress Macross also achieved worldwide success after being adapted respectively as Star Blazers and Robotech. Around this time, especially in the U.S. anime exploded in popularity becoming mainstream through scholars in media studies, cultural studies, sociology and anthropology.
        
        The 1988 film Akira went on to become an international success. Later, in 2004, the same creators produced Steamboy, which became the most expensive anime film. Spirited Away shared the first prize at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival and won the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while Innocence: Ghost in the Shell was featured at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.</p>

            Instead of continuing the anime as Dragon Ball, Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. Dragon Ball Z (ドラゴンボールZ(ゼット), Doragon Bōru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji TV on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996. Two television specials based on the Z series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Frieza – Son Goku's Father~, renamed Bardock – The Father of Goku by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, Defiance in the Face of Despair!! The Remaining Super-Warriors: Gohan and Trunks, renamed The History of Trunks by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on February 24, 1993.<br/></p>

            Dragon Ball GT (ドラゴンボールGT(ジーティー), Doragon Bōru Jī Tī, G(rand) T(ouring))[88] premiered on Fuji TV on February 7, 1996, and ran until November 19, 1997, for 64 episodes.[15] Unlike the first two anime series, it is not based on Akira Toriyama's original Dragon Ball manga,[89] being created by Toei Animation as a sequel to the series or as Toriyama called it, a "grand side story of the original Dragon Ball."[88] Toriyama designed the main cast, the spaceship used in the show, the design of three planets, and came up with the title and logo. In addition to this, Toriyama also oversaw production of the series, just as he had for the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z anime. The television special episode, Goku's Side Story! The Proof of his Courage is the Four-Star Ball, or A Hero's Legacy as Funimation titled it for their dub, aired on March 26, 1997, between episodes 41 and 42, serving as a kind of precursor to the epilogue to the series shown at the end of episode 64.</p><br/>

            In February 2009, Dragon Ball Z celebrated its 20th anniversary, with Toei Animation announcing that it would broadcast a re-edited and remastered version of the Dragon Ball Z anime under the name Dragon Ball Kai (ドラゴンボール改, Doragon Bōru Kai, lit. "Dragon Ball Revised"). The footage would be re-edited to follow the manga more closely, eliminating scenes and episodes which were not featured in the original manga, resulting in a more faithful adaptation, as well as in a faster-moving, and more focused story. The episodes were remastered for HDTV, with rerecording of the vocal tracks by most of the original cast, and featuring updated opening and ending sequences. On April 5, 2009, the series premiered in Japan airing in Fuji TV. Dragon Ball Z Kai reduced the episode count to 159 episodes (167 episodes internationally), from the original footage of 291 episodes. Damaged frames were removed, resulting in some minor shots being remade from scratch in order to fix cropping, and others to address continuity issues. The majority of the international versions, including Funimation Entertainment's English dub, are titled Dragon Ball Z Kai.</p><br/>

The first 135 episodes were adapted from Part I of the manga; the remaining 85 episodes are original and use plot elements that are not in the manga. Tetsuya Nishio was the character designer for Naruto when the manga was adapted into an anime series; Kishimoto had requested that Nishio be given this role. Beginning on April 29, 2009, the original Naruto anime began a rerun on Wednesdays and Thursdays (until the fourth week of September 2009 when it changed to only Wednesdays). It was remastered in HD, with new 2D and 3D effects, under the name Naruto: Shōnen Hen. Episodes from the series have been released on both VHS and DVD, and collected as boxed sets.

Planning to take over Kaya's business, he kills her lawyer Merry, gets Zoro knocked out, and has their bodies dumped in a well.

Zoro rescues Luffy from the Marines and battles Kuro's subordinates, while Luffy takes on Kuro. They save Kaya, and Kuro flees the island. Kaya rewards them with the ship the crew had wanted, which Luffy dubs the Going Merry in honor of Kaya's lawyer. Usopp accepts his invitation to join the crew, and is kissed by Kaya before he leaves.

Garp and Helmeppo tell Koby that Mihawk is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, powerful pirates whom the government found it more useful to ally with. When Mihawk arrives at Baratie, Zoro, who has idolized Mihawk since childhood, challenges him to a duel to win his title. Zoro viciously loses the duel and is severely wounded, though Mihawk lets him and Luffy go free out of respect for their resolve. A humbled Zoro swears to Luffy that he will never lose again, before losing consciousness.</p>
                <h3>Season 6</h3>
                <p>Zeff, the owner of Baratie, treats an unconscious Zoro but is unsure if he will survive. Sanji tells the Straw Hats that the captain must make hard decisions, such as when Zeff saved a young Sanji's life by giving the latter all of the food on a deserted island while he ate his own leg. He also reveals his dream to find the All Blue, an area where all four seas meet and contains rare spices and fish. Koby learns of Garp and Luffy's relationship. Feared pirate and fish-man Arlong arrives in search of the Grand Line map, having taken Buggy's head hostage to find him. As he is about kill Luffy, Nami hands over the map, revealing that she is a member of Arlong's crew. Arlong throws Luffy into the sea and leaves with Nami; Sanji rescues him. In disbelief, Luffy feels he has failed as a captain until Zoro awakens and swears to stand by him as his first mate. Sanji joins the Straw Hats as their cook.

                <p>Under Buggy's direction, the Straw Hats arrive at Conomi Island, where Coco Village, Nami's home, is under Arlong's rule. They meet Nojiko, her adoptive sister, who reveals that as children, Arlong killed their adoptive mother Bell-mère. Garp questions Zeff about Luffy's whereabouts, revealing that he does not want his grandson to end up executed like Roger. Nami reveals to Nojiko that she has been working for Arlong since her Bell-mère's death to buy Coco village's freedom by paying him 100 million berry. When Nami informs Arlong that she finally has the money, he betrays her by bribing Marine Captain Nezumi to hide his crimes and confiscate Nami's money. With her efforts having gone in vain, Nami has a breakdown, stabbing her arm to remove Arlong's tattoo. When she is stopped by Luffy, she begs for his help. As the Straw Hats rally together, Arlong attacks Coco Village.</p>
                <h3>Season 8</h3>
                <p>The Straw Hats attack Arlong Park, during which Buggy reclaims his body and flees. Realizing that Arlong's tower contains 8 years of Nami's painful memories of cartography — the maps being vital in his goal to take over the four seas — Luffy destroys the tower and brings it down on the fish-man, defeating him and freeing Nami and her village in the process. Koby and Helmeppo refuse Garp's orders to arrest the Straw Hats, knowing they are innocent. Luffy unwillingly fights his grandfather. Though Garp easily has the upper hand, Luffy stands firm, which convinces Garp to relent; he had simply been testing Luffy to make sure this was what he really wanted. As revenge for failing to pin the attack on the Straw Hats, Captain Nezumi puts out a wanted poster of Luffy, fulfilling his dream of having one. Shanks and his crew celebrate Luffy's bounty with Mihawk, while Buggy and Alvida meet. Garp, impressed with Koby and Helmeppo's will to stand by what is right, decides to personally train them. As the Straw Hats embark on their journey to the Grand Line as a proper crew for the first time, Marine Captain Smoker burns Luffy's bounty poster.</p>
